  My name is Paulina and I’m 29 years old. I am originally from Poland but I moved to UK almost 7 years ago.  I can describe myself as observant, energetic and creative person. I like reading books, my favourite book genres are thriller, fantasy and personal development. My favourite book series from my childhood is Harry Potter. Do you remember this one?

  <p id="career">
    One of my biggest passions are singing and playing the piano. I moved to England because I wanted to explore the world, meet new people and learn more about different cultures. I really like living in UK but I never had a good work opportunity where I would feel fulfilled and rewarded. That is why I was happy to discover Code your Future course as it might be a great opportunity to change my career path. I am really excited about learning the new skills thanks to this course and there are a lot of reasons why I would like to continue to be a part of Code Your Future community. The main reason why I like tech industry is an opportunity to  constantly learn and grow. I have always been enjoying learning new things and achieving new goals. I am a creative person and although I do not know a lot about tech industry I am really excited to learn more about it. The tech industry has great working environment and opportunity to work in a culture-oriented place. There are numerous job opportunities and work-life balance and flexibility, which is very desirable and also difficult to find in a modern world. It is a sector filled with creativity and I would be happy to improve my problem solving skills and learn how to invent new solutions. What is also important that tech industry continues to thrive and there is constant increase in demand for people with technical skills.
